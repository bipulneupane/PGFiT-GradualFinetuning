# NearMapDataCollector
This repo provides the sample code to collect aerial image tiles of the City of Melbourne using the Nearmap Tile API. This codes in this repo can be used to generate the Melbourne Building Dataset for a paper that is currently "submitted" to an academic journal for possible publication.

Please use the Jupyter notebook "Data_gather_from_NearmapTileAPI" dataset. The image tiles can be downloaded from Nearmap's Tile API service. Please visit their website for the details and additional documentation. You will need an API key to generate the data.

Building samples of the City of Melbourne are available in the CityPolygon folder as "polygons_edited.shp", which is collected from: https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/2020-building-footprints/information/

Acknowledgement:
The authors would like to thank Nearmap for providing the API service to collect the image data for the experiments.
